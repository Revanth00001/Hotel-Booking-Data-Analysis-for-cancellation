# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-for-cancellation
Hotel booking data analysis for cancellations involves examining a dataset that contains information about hotel bookings and understanding the patterns, trends, and factors related to booking cancellations. 
    Cancellation Overview:
        The percentage of bookings that were canceled vs. not canceled is calculated and displayed.
        The reservation status (canceled or not) is visually presented using a bar chart.

    Hotel Type Comparison:
        A comparison of the reservation status counts between different types of hotels (Resort Hotel vs. City Hotel) is performed using a countplot.
        The cancellation percentages for both types of hotels are calculated and displayed.

    Average Daily Rate (ADR):
        A comparison of the Average Daily Rate between Resort and City Hotels is plotted over time using line plots. This could indicate price trends and differences between the two types of hotels.

    Monthly Reservation Trends:
        Reservation trends are visualized per month using a countplot. This provides insights into which months have higher or lower reservation activity and cancellation rates.

    ADR Per Month for Canceled Bookings:
        The Average Daily Rate for canceled bookings is plotted per month. This could help identify if there are specific months with higher cancellation rates and associated price changes.

    Top Cancellation Countries:
        The top 10 countries with the highest number of canceled reservations are visualized using a pie chart. This shows which countries contribute the most to booking cancellations.

    Market Segment Analysis:
        The distribution of market segments is displayed using value counts and normalized value counts. This provides insights into the distribution of bookings across different market segments.

These insights offer a comprehensive overview of cancellation trends, pricing patterns, and customer behavior within the dataset. However, for a more detailed and actionable analysis, further exploration of the relationships between different features, building predictive models, and conducting additional statistical tests to validate the findings might be considered. Moreover, the interpretation of these insights and making informed decisions based on the analysis would be aided by domain knowledge and context about the hotel industry.
